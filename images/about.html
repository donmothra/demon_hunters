      <h3>ABOUT</h3>
      <p>Originally published in 1984, Baku Yumemakura’s masterpiece Demon Hunters is a fantasy world filled with eroticism and ultra-violence! The series has already sold more than 4.8 million copies in Japan. Bikoo is proud to bring this first book in The Psyche Diver Series to a wider audience.</p>
      <p>Demon Hunters was a groundbreaking entry in the world of Sci-Fi Fantasy: using a machine to enter the mind of another, present day Sci-Fi, and the use of  real history as a basis for fantasy. These things are taken for granted now, but were revolutionary at the time.  Much like the characters in his books, Baku Yumemakura is always stretching the boundaries of his form, and with Demon Hunters he reached new heights.</p>
      <p>Kukai is one of the Japan’s most important symbols: the self-mummified corpse of Kobo Daishi, the man who spread Buddhism throughout the country.  The corpse is held at a chamber in a monastery on Mt. Koya.  It is believed that Kukai is still alive, forever meditating in a state of Nirvana.  It has been told that his spirit can be seen floating in the chamber.  One monk at the monastery cares for Kukai by providing a change of clothes and food just like he were still living. That monk is the only person that knows whether the legends of Kukai are true.</p>
      <p>The Psyche Diver Series<br />
        Demon Hunters is everything we love about Baku Yumemakura’s writing:  pulpy violence and intense sexuality; a fantasy world filled with sex hungry, blood drinking, kung-fu fighting monks, incredible battles, and a man that kills a bear with his hands.  Baku Yumemakura’s works are defined by a reverie for feeling: the experience of love, violence, anger, empathy and yearning–the feel of a freshly opened wound.  Baku Yumemakura is a master of intensity.      </p>
      <p>Demon Hunters: Desires of the Flesh is a book that Bikoo fought hard to release. We fell in love with the balance of the title: the violence and sexuality is palpable, but never reaches the level of exploitation. Underneath the blindingly fast pace is a deep base historical foundation. The history of Kukai (Kobo Daishi), the different sects of Buddhism, different martial arts styles, the underground culture, and fantastic battles are the things that excite us.</p>
